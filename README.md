# Binary-Search-Tree-in-C-with-Insertion-and-Search-Functions

  This is a C program for binary search tree operations, including insertion and searching for a given key. The code defines a structure called node with integer key value, and two pointers for left and right child nodes. It also has several functions, including creating a new node, inserting a new node to the tree, printing the nodes in order, and searching for a given key in the tree.

  The program reads integer values from an input file called "input.txt", inserts them into the tree, and then prompts the user to enter a key value to search for in the tree. If the key exists in the tree, the program prints "At Depth level" message on the screen. If the key does not exist in the tree or the user enters 0, the program terminates.
